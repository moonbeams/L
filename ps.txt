Hi, I come from China, growing at a small city Lu¡¯an, Anhui, beginning my college life at Qingdao, Shandong when I was 17 years old, and now, I am working as a python programmer at Beijing.
I have graduated one year and a few mouths, sometimes I would look back on my college life. Although it is not the legendary life in my imaginary, I do learned a lot of things. Besides the classes that I have to take, during the first two years of my college life, I entered Electronic and Communication lab to learn programming and SCM, work on some projects with my partners and compete with students from all over the province in Undergraduate Electronics Design Contest. Then I started learning English for Toefl and GRE test. I also learned jazz drum and guitar when I was in college. These things helped with my life until now and I believe, will be the same in the future.
After leaving school, I went to Beijing, found a job as a python programmer in Beijing Fronware Software Company, a company focus on virtualization. What I need to do is the development of server virtualization. We use vCenter/vServer model to manage servers, then we can create virtual machine by the support of KVM module in CentOS 7.2(we recently updated our system from 6.5 to 7.2), but it is not just simple like this. It also contains Network virtualization like VLAN and storage virtualization like SAN and many other service like Corosync, OVS and so on.
